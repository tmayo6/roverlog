v0.91 - 07/09/2000 - Made lookup only get the remote station in their
                     current grid vs. first found grid.

v0.92 - 07/10/2000 - Added rover rules variable to select between old
                     and new rules.

v0.93 - 07/14/2000 - Fixed removal of contacts for dupe checking and
                     fixed map drawing.

v0.94 - 09/12/2000 - Set default values before loading .ini file in
                     case the .ini file doesn't set everything.

v0.95 - 09/12/2000 - Major overhaul on File commands.  Made default
                     field to go to the UTC field if in manual time
                     mode.

v0.96 - 09/13/2000 - Implemented auto save.

v0.97 - 09/13/2000 - Added log list height customization.

v0.98 - 09/26/2000 - Made change to copy sent grid value to map
                     center when first drawing the map.  After this,
                     the sent and center fields are decoupled.

v0.99 - 09/29/2000 - Added summary sheet generation.

v0.991 - 10/02/2000 - Revised Log/Edit button scheme.  Trimmed out some
                      unused procedures.

v0.992 - 6/12/2001 - Fixed a bug in the bearing/distance calculator
                     so the distance is correct now. Fixed a bug in
                     reading in files that caused the program to
                     crash when reading in a blank line.

v0.993 - 6/18/2001 - Added Date and UTC checking when logging a QSO.
                     Made default action for pressing Enter to replace
                     existing QSO while in edit mode.  Made default
                     action for Dupe popup to cancel logging the current
                     QSO.  Made the multiplier annunciator
                     non-focus-grabbing.  Made it so My Call and Sent
                     fields are edited in a separate window so control
                     flows over them normally as they do not change much.
                     Made the program search for the last known grid for
                     a given station when focus leaves the callsign field.
                     (Note:  these changes were aptly suggested by Ed
                     Grosso, N1FGY).

v0.994 - 9/10/2001 - Changed date format to YYYY-MM-DD to meet Cabrillo
                     standard.  Files read in with MM/DD/YYYY date format
                     will be converted to the new format.  Sorting by date
                     works properly now. Changed map again so that worked
                     grids are reverse video.

v0.995 - X/XX/XXXX - Changed map window to use different color highlights
                     for the number of QSOs per worked grid.

                   - Added lookup delete
                   - Made lookup tell you what you need instead of what
                     you have.

                     when done so entering multiple skeds is easier.
                   - Allow changing call and grid from main window instead
                     of in a separate box.  This makes making skeds easier.
                     Tab still makes the cursor go from UTC to Call for
                     easier paper log copying.

1_2_4 - 2002-08-16 - Fixed bug in To_LatLon that used the wrong
                     5th and 6th digits if only 4 digits were provided
                     by the user.  This would cause extremely erroneous
                     results if the calculator was used with a 4 digit
                     grid to/from a 6 digit grid.
                   - Made option ::setting(clearentry) to erase entry fields

                     appear in the annunciator if the last QSO for that
                     multiplier was deleted and then a new QSO was made.
                   - Modularized access to the debug log to allow
                     bypassing debug messages for code releases. I think
                     this was causing sluggish performance.
                   - Added a station stack that keeps a record of the
                     five most recent calls and grids and allows rotating

                   - Save lookupgrid database when done loading log.
                   - Fixed bug when deleting first entry in the log.
                   - Made key/dekey more robust to prevent lockup.
                   - Added option ::setting(netpopup) to allow focus-grabbing
                     for network chat messages.

                   - Made inied.tcl descriptions more helpful.
                   - Allow a different rig server for each band.  The server
                     can be started multiple times with different serial and
                     IP ports.  Also, if the serial port is left empty, the
                     server will not attempt to communicate with a rig.
                     Instead, you can enter the frequency (for testing).

                     against trying to close a port that has already been
                     closed.

1_5_5 - 2003-06-18 - Fixed merge function so that headers are not
                     duplicated in the log.  Yikes, that was a bad one!
                   - Do dupe checking when tabbing out of the call field.
                   - Removed Alt-Spacebar mapping because it conflicts
                     with Windows.
                   - Fixed F10 mapping to raise the main window as well as
                     bring focus to the call entry.
                   - Mapped Alt-Key-F4 to hide the current window.
                   - When QSYing, do not redraw map unless displayed (makes
                     changing bands A LOT faster, hopefully obviating the
                     need to make Alt-B bring down a menu for band changes.

1_5_6 - 2003-07-18 - Fixed key bindings to use legal names for Unix.
                   - Fixed "-state readonly" references to check for
                     version 8.4 before executing.
                   - Fixed sorting by call to ignore trailing "/" suffixes.
                   - Made manual time entry warning configurable to
                     prevent bugging after-the-fact loggers too much.

1_5_7 - 2003-09-08 - Added keyerttycontrol option to allow control of 
                     desired handshaking lines for keyer serial port.
                   - Added serttycontrol option to rig.tcl to allow powering
                     widget circuits off the serial port by turning on RTS,
                     DTR, and/or other signals.
                   - Added Yaesu FT-1000 support to rig.tcl.
                   - Improved polling configuration for rig.tcl.
                   - Made Update_Freq send every time it runs instead
                     of only when the operating frequency changes.

1_6_0 - 2003-10-13 - Added bands and notes to lookup file and window.
                   - Save window locations/states on exit, restore on start.
                   - Added a score indicator on the main window.
                   - Added "Save Settings" option under the Tools menu to
                     allow saving all user settings to roverlog.ini.

1_7_0 - 2003-10-29 - Added rotor control server and Calc "Move Rotor"
                     button.  This works with the RC2800DC rotor for now.
                     Need to find out what other rotors people are using
                     to know what to add.

1_7_1 - 2004-01-08 - Corrected rotor.ini and rig.ini syntax errors.
                   - Removed line setting hidden file attribute on the
                     .roverlog_state.tcl file to prevent *NIX problems.
                   - Changed all serial port mode strings to lower case
                     (i.e. n,8,1 instead of N,8,1) to prevent *NIX problems.
                   - Made rig.tcl frequency display format consistent
                     with 4 decimal places.
                   - Added support for Hygain DCU-1 rotor controller.

1_7_2 - 2004-01-15 - Corrected "clock scan" error when adding a sked.

1_8_1 - 2004-01-22 - Revamped skeduling completely.  It should be a lot
                     easier to use now.
                   - Made it so duplicate entries are allowed in the lookup
                     file when loading.  Fields are now concatenated in the
                     lookupgrid and lookupband databases.
                   - Made it so you can do a partial lookup without having
                     worked a station before (i.e. from the lookupgrid
                     database.
                   - When loading the lookup database, use 6-digit grids
                     to replace existing identical 4-digit grids, but not
                     vice-versa.
                   - Made passing more user friendly.  Don't just send a
                     message, bring up the sked window.  Handle pass freqs
                     well too.

1_8_2 - 2004-01-22 - Added creation of shortcuts for remaining RoverLog
                     Utilities to start menu.

1_8_3 - 2004-01-27 - Added Yaesu FT-817 support to rig.tcl.  Needs test.
                   - Corrected shortcut text for Alt-Key-b (Bandlock).
                   - Added Alt-Key-j binding to Move Rotor.
                   - Made space work similar to tab in call and recd.
                   - Made network send to "all" skip peer entries that
                     are blank or have zero for the port number.
                   - Made adding or deleting a sked advance you to the next
                     time slot afterwards.
                   - Added creation of desktop shortcut to installer.
                   - Fixed some time lags by disabling debugging.
                   - Added <contest>basic.ini files that are abbreviated
                     for more common setups.
                   - Allow selection of IP address for connection to GPS
                     and Rotor servers.  This allows one server to serve
                     multiple RoverLogs on a network.
                   - Made Shortcuts help window smaller and added scrollbar.
                   - Made grid/QSOs list in Score window span columns to
                     make that window less tall on the screen.
                   - Made default font size 8 instead of 10.  See above.
                   - Only redraw lookup window if it is open at the time.
                     This should improve lag a lot.
                   - Recent entries in the log from another peer are colored
                     gray instead of the default black.
                   - Added "Send Skeds" button to Net window to refresh skeds
                     on other peer stations.

1_8_4 - 2004-02-04 - Added a utility to generate contest-specific headers.
                   - Added example .ini files for Linux and updated docs.
                   - Corrected the "label" syntax error bug under Linux.
                   - Corrected a debug message in rig.tcl for FT-817.
                   - Corrected mode options in inied.tcl to work with Linux.
                   - Updated README.TXT to be more clear on serial ports.

1_8_5 - 2004-06-07 - Bundled RoverLog with freewrap561 (vs. old freewrap55).
                   - Made call entry-bound lookup wait for 2 characters to
                     be entered before doing the lookup.
                   - Added a debug statement before the array search start
                     in Do_Lookup to gauge delay of that step.

1_8_6 - 2004-06-11 - Added some info to Help->About.
                   - Added libsnack.dll from Tcl/Tk 8.4.6 to package.
                   - Rig and GPS Server failures no longer wipe out previous
                     information, and GPS Server failure falls back to
                     setting date and time from PC Clock.

1_8_7 - 2004-06-12 - Added "Request Frequency" feature on startup and by
                     button press on the Net window.

1_9_0 - 2004-08-19 - Instead of checking for blank replies from the GPS
                     server, check for grid, date, and UTC syntax errors.
                     This should prevent wacky results from getting into
                     RoverLog's fields.
                   - Made the Sked window have its own network peer instead
                     of linking it with the Net window's field.
                   - Prevent reinitializing Sked window fields when bringing
                     up that window.
                   - Made Net and Sked windows sticky upon pressing Enter
                     instead of making them disappear.
                   - Show what this station is sending in the Net messages
                     log as well as showing what's received.
                   - Heavily revamped the sked window for ease of use.
                   - Added concept of Work In Progress (WIP), a location
                     where skeds that have come due go until they are worked.
                   - Added Alt-A shortcut that accepts the next WIP.
                   - Added concept of Busy timer (in minutes) that can be set
                     by a station to prevent anyone else from passing for a
                     time.
                   - WIP and Busy are shared across the network.
                   - Heavily revamped networking for better maintainability.
                   - Made many cosmetic improvements to most windows.
                   - Overhauled the way the operating frequency is set
                     and handled.  Now, a zero port number in the rig
                     setup will assume a manually entered operating frequency
                     for that band.  The rigctrl setting now goes away.

1_9_1 - 2004-08-27 - Fixed spacebar behavior in call and recd fields.
                     Spacebar now toggles you between these fields whereas
                     Tab and Shift-Tab send you through all fields as normal.
                   - Made Linux and Darwin platforms skip setting the icon
                     for windows on all applications.
                   - Reverted roverlog.tcl back to using no CRs at the end
                     of every line.  Having CRs broke the Linux version.
                     Either way is supported under Windows.
                   - Made references to ::tcl_platform() global instead of
                     local.

1_9_2 - 2004-09-01 - Made quicksked and quicknet options to switch focus to
                     Call Entry on Main Window after Sked and Net use.
                   - Removed skedfreq option.  This is taken care of by the
                     frequency list.

1_9_3 - XXXX-XX-XX - Made inied range for sked time increment 5 to 60 in
                     steps of 5.

2_0_0 - 2004-10-15

- Added "annbell" option to enable/disable the bell on annunciator (info)
  messages.
- Added "quicklookup" option to enable/disable hiding the partial window
  upon pressing one of the "Copy" buttons.
- Made Alt-Key-A binding accept WIP in all windows.
- Added HCO Light.  Warns you if you have typed in the Call or Recd Entry or
  changed bands without logging.
- Made grid lookup only happen once so that what you typed for a received
  grid does not get wiped out if you furiously hit spacebar like some ops.
- Only do a partial lookup if the call has changed.
- Only do a bearing calc if the recd grid has changed.
- Made the Info field shorter, thereby shrinking the entire main window.
- Return entries to old values on Cancel Edit (instead of leaving edit
  values in).
- Display WIP, limit, and busy timer in Sked window.
- Display only one Net Log entry for messages sent to all.
- Highlight messages for me in the Net Log.
- Added magnetic bearing and reverse to calculator disp.
- Made the arrow keys work in the Sked List.
- Made network-initiated redraws of the Sked List leave the list and
  selection alone when done.
- Made spacebar from the call and recd fields act better. It doesn't select
  the entire field any more, but if there are question marks in the field it
  selects the first one.
- Established the concept of "blacklisting" the various network connections
  (keyer, gps, rotor, rigs, and peers) so that if they do not work once,
  they are not tried again until the operator un-blacklists them.  This
  should prevent misconfigurations or faulty networks from slowing RoverLog
  down.
- Made a simpler Pass window that can be used instead of the Sked window for
  immediate passes.  This also uses a different net message to prevent
  timing issues from dropping passes.  In other words, a pass is now
  guaranteed to get added to WIP if received vs. having to go through the
  sked list first.
- Added a "wipbusy" setting that allows you to specify a number of minutes
  to set the busy timer to when you accept WIP.
- Made the Lookup window select (if possible) the line that matches the
  current station, grids, etc.
- Made band changes in the Pass and Sked windows look up the last operating
  frequency used on that band.
- Moved the keyer out of the main program to allow its use stand-alone
  without logging with RoverLog and to improve performance.
- Removed the keyer options from inied.tcl and move them to default.rlk.
- Added the ability for operators to select their own voice keyer setup and
  save it so that when operators switch they can switch "profiles".  This
  will also allow rovers to set up ahead of time for different grids and
  switch grid profiles after moving.

2_0_1 - 2004-10-21

- Removed unused "Partial" button and converted remaining lookups to partial.
- Corrected the magnetic bearing calculation.

2_0_2 - 2005-01-08

- Changed bad reference to Sked_Check to Check_Sked.
- Corrected arguments to Add_WIP in Update_Both that had caused an error
  when a sked was moved into WIP.
- Moved voice keying into external keyer where it is supposed to be.
- Removed left over keyer references.

2_1_0 - 2005-01-11

- Consolidated main window buildup into Build_Main.
- Reversed wm commands in Store_Loc to permit window locations to work.
- Added keyer play buttons to the RoverLog keyer window.  Removed IP address
  and port from this dialog.
- Added the ability for RoverLog to start its modules (gps, keyer, rig,
  rotor, roverclk) on start up.
- Corrected setting RoverLog window locations on startup.
- Added capability for modules to store and restore locations.


2_1_1 - 2005-01-15

- Fixed multiplier display in log window to work properly.  It was a color
  for non-dupes before, not new mults like it should be.
- Fixed score redraw to give the bottom line in the entry to the bottom
  left of the main window again.  I had stopped the score from being
  calculated to try to save CPU after each entry, but I think it's better
  to have this displayed.
- Added user configuration of log colors for new multipliers (net and local).
- Made F1-Fn selectable between QSYing to Band 1-n and playing Keyer message
  1-n.
- Somewhere previously made Alt-Key-b QSY up and Alt-Key-B QSY down.
- Added buddies lookup function Alt-Key-L (Alt-Key-l is still partial
  lookup). Enter buddies in inied.tcl.

2_1_2 - 2005-01-18

- Fixed module spawning so it checks for OS version to use correct exec
  string for non-Windows OSs.

2_1_3 - 2005-01-18

- Fixed keyer to allow sound for Darwin (MAC OS).
- Fixed roverclk to skip setting the -topmost attribute if not under windows.
- Fixed RoverLog to correctly restore subwindow locations even if spawning
  other modules.
- Changed default serial port for Darwin (MAC OS) to /dev/cu.USA19QW11P1.1.

2_1_4 - 2005-01-20

- Changed F10 and F11 to QSY to bands 9 and 10 if set for QSY (vs. Keyer).
- Changed F12 to go to call field (instead of F10).
- Added Buddies lookup button below Lookup button.  Alt-Key-L still works
  too.
- Added Speed and Course fields to Calc and GPS server for Rovers to line up
  with.
- Made Pass window go away after entering a pass for myself.  It already went
  away when making a pass to someone else.
- Made Sked/Pass Freq come from the Peer's Operating Freq on Popping up Pass
  or Sked.
- Made Sked window "now" redraw for the next time increment.  Passes are for
  the true "now".
- Made the periodic frequency updater save any entry into the LO/Operating
  Frequency before refreshing to avoid wiping out manually-entered values.
- Made left and right bracket work to toggle through peers when focus is in
  the sked list.
- Added an entry for enabling/disabling sound card access in the keyer since
  it is still meaningful to have the keyer in case you have a TNC or other
  device that will key CW based on serial ASCII input.
  
2_1_5 - 2005-01-21

- Made network new multipliers display in the correct color.
- Made it so if I hear from a blacklisted peer, unblacklist him. This should
  fix A LOT of multi-op difficulty.

2_1_6 - 2005-02-14

- Module .ini files are no longer overwritten on install without explicit
  request.
- Corrected internal error when logging a dupe.
- Added check for modules already running on startup.
- Added module stop on RoverLog exit.
- Now the lookup list is updated on logging a QSO.
- If the band is locked, the WIP band is ignored on WIP acceptance.
- Made File->New always ask for confirmation.  Alt ... Enter Enter used to
  wipe out log without warning due to File->New default menu pick.
- Made accepting WIP push accepted WIP into Alt-Z call stack.
- Remove stations from WIP if worked without accepting.
- Added auto-save of module .ini files on module exit.
- Shortened window titles to better see what windows are in taskbar when
  minimized.
- Operator name setting is removed from roverlog.ini.
- RoverLog only sends 4-digit grids to Keyer now.

2_1_7 - 2005-03-27

- RoverLog now displays lookup database information in addition to
  information from QSOs in the lookup window.
- Made Keyer Module properly load voice messages on opening a file.

2_2_0 - 2005-04-10

- RoverLog now displays lookup database information in addition to
  information from QSOs in the lookup window in buddies mode.
- K1EL WinKey support added to Keyer.
- Added support for executing an external mixer program upon keying and
  dekeying using RoverLog's Keyer.  This can allow you, for example, to
  send the microphone input of your PC to your rig interface when RoverLog
  is not keying.  See README_KEYER.TXT.

2_2_1 - 2005-04-15

- Corrected Keyer state transitions when changing between Transparent and
  WinKey CW keying.
- Improved checking when making a pass for out of touch desination peers.
- On each window, made default action buttons for <Return> light red to
  denote action.
- Made map redraw more robust.

2_2_2 - 2005-05-08

- Made spacebar bring you back to the last cursor position in the call
  and recd fields.
- Made peer communications use a new -async option to further reduce
  networking delays.
- Added option for received grid lookup (when going out of the call field)
  to only fill in the recd grid for worked stations.

2_2_3 - 2005-05-28

- Fixed bug when looking up last grid for known stations where multiple
  grids would appear in the Recd field on the main window.
- Added a check for the contest ini file to prevent an exception when
  trying to source that file.

2_2_4 - 2005-06-06

- If a network peer is blacklisted, still try to communicate next time.
  There is no delay now because of the callback method used when opening
  outgoing sockets.
- Send messages to peers in non-blocking mode to prevent the unlikely
  possibility that the socket open works but the send does not.

2_2_5 - 2005-06-08

- Made keyer wait 500 ms before sending WinKey initialization message
  after setting handshake lines to allow power from serial port lines to
  settle.
- Corrected "hang" bug when setting computer time in GPS Module.
- Added setting computer time in GPS Module under Linux.

2_2_6 - 2005-06-28

- Made incoming net logs stop changing the lookup results and the map center.
- Made logging a QSO only scroll down when logging if the view is already
  at the bottom.  This prevents unwanted scrolling while reviewing the log.
- Made band lock prevent F-Key QSYing.
- Made updates for WIP, etc. happen periodically instead of by exception.
  This should help keep these items much more up to date, especially on crappy
  network segments.
- Made keyer stop looping with WinKey when CW keying is stopped.
- Made modules ask for exit confirmation if exiting via user action (vs.
  network exit command).
- Made first spacebar out a new call select the whole received grid field
  instead of putting the cursor after the grid.  Successive spacebars for
  the same call do not change the received grid and place the cursor after
  the grid.
- Added a state machine for looking up the received grid square from the
  callsign when moving from the call field to the received field.  If the
  user typed something in for the received grid, it is locked so that the
  lookup is not performed until the QSO is logged, even if the call changes.
- Made module icons different for easy identification in the Windows
  taskbar---cool!
- When the user quits a module, we now ask "are you sure?"  It would be
  bad to exit a module RoverLog is depending on.
- We now use a red color if the user has WIP to work (passes or skeds that
  have come due).
- We now flag net messages sent to all as such on reception so they don't look
  unicast.
- We removed the Alt-g, Alt-r, and Alt-q shortcuts to prevent accidents.
- Smartened up many startup and incremental algorithms to reduce startup and
  net service time.  RoverLog used to take a LONG time to start up.  It turns
  out that the major time hogs on startup were insertion of QSOs into the log
  list and dupe lookup to protect the integrity of the internal lookup
  database.  With improvements in these two areas, startup time on my machine
  was reduced from 24 seconds to around 4 seconds for a 2.25 million point
  log.
- Added progress indication for loading in log.  Not sure if I like this.
  Feedback welcome.
- For Keyer, added speed pot readback and update for WinKey so speed can be
  dynamically controlled during WinKey playback---very cool.
- For Keyer, made it so characters sent via the physical paddles are inserted
  into message 6 (the scratchpad message)---awesome.
- Made blacklisting for non-peer items much more visible with every item
  shown via a red button or other widget on the main window.
- Made GPS Module non-blocking to make operation more responsive.  This helps
  A LOT!
- Made GPS Module blank fields if no GPS data is detected for 10 seconds.
  This will cause the main RoverLog program to blacklist the GPS module and
  make it clear that something is going on.
- Made RoverLog always get its time from the PC clock instead of optionally
  from the GPS Module.  This is safer.  See the manual.
- Made the GPS Module warn the user if the GPS time and the PC time are off
  by a lot (> 10 sec).  This shows up as the time set Enable button colored
  red.
- RoverLog now shipped with smaller Freewrap 6.0 instead of 5.61.
- Added operating Mode to Rig Module capabilities and RoverLog main program
  reporting.  Works for Icom, need testers for Kenwood and Yaesu.
- Removed UTC Offset setting.  This can be calculated internally to the Tcl
  interpretter to remove human error.  This means users no longer have to
  set this and the PC time can be set to any time zone but RoverLog still
  knows how to refer to everything in terms of UTC.  RoverClk, the GPS Module
  and the main RoverLog program were affected.
- Added option to omit log sort buttons from the main window if desired.

2_2_7 - 2005-07-27

- Fixed network logging UTC offset error.
- Fixed network error of trying to Blacklist my own peer number.

2_2_8 - 2005-08-24

- Made RoverClk background colors configurable in inied.tcl.  Goofy.
- When comparing QSOs for Rover checking, FN13 vs. FN13ec would cause RoverLog
  to prompt to log as a Rover.  This is now fixed.
- Added a manual grid field to the calculator window to allow bearing
  calculation without disturbing the QSO entry fields.
- Added advance warning for skeds to warn you BEFORE each sked comes up.
- Fixed the network logging UTC offset error for received messages.
- Looked for WinKey problem only playing part of a CW keyer message.  Cannot
  find a problem here.  Need help to reproduce.
- Disabled resizing RoverLog windows unless there is a meaningful way to do so.
- Made resizable windows expand/contract list or text areas.
- Added note in manual suggesting turning up the Auto Save Interval for large
  stations that experience lagging performance later in the contest.  If you
  set the Auto Save Interval to 5 instead of 1, the log will be saved with
  every 5th QSO vs. every QSO.  This should prevent a lot of slow down.  Note
  that if you change the interval to a number larger than 1, you need to be
  careful to save your log before exiting.

2_3_0 - 2005-09-07

- Added the ability to call an external program when changing bands.  This
  allows interfacing with the N3FTI parallel port interface via an external
  command line IO Port write utility (see next item).  For information on
  the N3FTI interface, see http://www.qsl.net/n3fti.
- Added a small command line utility "iopwr" that allows writing a value to
  an IO port such as the parallel port.  See the manual and README_iopwr.txt
  for more details.

2_3_1 - 2005-09-07

- Added a band menu button for the map window.
- Added yellow highlighting for important fields.

2_3_2 - 2005-09-18

- Resizing main window vertically now makes the log stretch vertically.
- Alt-W in sked window now clears all appropriate fields.
- F12 now also scrolls log display to the end in addition to returning to
  the call field.
- Keyer now checks for valid looping delay before scheduling loop.
- Module windows are now fixed size.
- If WinKey or voice keyer serial ports do not open, a popup is displayed.
- Verified that when I hit spacebar from the call field and a grid lookup
  is performed, the whole Received Grid field is highlighted, but when a
  lookup is not performed, the cursor returns to the last insert location.
- Alt-W and/or a different call in the Call field reset grid lookup so
  it is performed the next time the cursor is moved to the Received Grid
  field.
- When Band Lock is on, we no longer copy a QSO's band with "Copy QSO",
  we instead retain the current band.
- Added selection for Green Heron Engineering RT-20 rotor controller
  in Rotor Module.  This uses the Hygain DCU-1 protocol, so it's an alias.
- Added RC2800DC-alt syntax which sends A####.#[CR] instead of A[CR]####.#[CR]
  like the older RC2800DC protocol.
- Added a mechanism for the Keyer Module to accept CW message macro
  parameters without commanding a message to be sent over the air.
- Added the custom CW message field to the Main RoverLog Keyer window with
  some appropriate shortcuts (Alt-W clears, Enter sends).
- Made it so custom CW messages sent from the Main RoverLog Keyer window can
  contain macros.
- Added antenna offset for offset feeds or random rover vehicle orientation.
  See the manual for an explanation on how to use this feature.
- Added ADIF log exporting.
- Added configurable delay between opening voice keyer serial port and
  fconfiguring it.  This is to help handle slow USB serial ports.

2_3_3 - 2006-01-18

- Fixed a syntax error in rotor.tcl that would cause the module to start up
  with a blank window and fail to operate.
- Made it so the Keyer can operate without serial ports, i.e. blank settings.
  With this set up, you'll stomp on a foot pedal or use some other means to
  key the radio, then trigger the keyer separately.
- Made it so the keyer comes up with the "mygrid" setting from its .ini file
  as the "sent" entry by default.
- Fixed a bunch of syntax errors in the Rig Module that would make it fail to
  interface to any rigs properly.
- Corrected the manual's discussion of saving mixer settings using the QuickMix
  external mixer program.
- Added a statement to the manual indicating that RoverLog stores all of its
  files (including logs) in the installation folder/directory.
- Made it so the installer places a shortcut to the RoverLog folder on your
  desktop as a further clue to where the log ends up.

2_4_0 - 

- Made it so the external band switch command is not executed when editing a
  QSO or at other times when we're not really changing the band of operation.
- When logging a QSO with "real time" selected, update RoverLog's time just
  before commiting the QSO to the log to prevent time freezes from occuring
  in the log.
- Changed all band references from 903 to 902 to meet Cabrillo standard.
- Removed "LIGHT" band references.  The Cabrillo standard calls for "300" to
  be used for laser QSOs.
- Added Super Lookup module for using an external database to lookup calls
  that have never been worked. AWESOME!
- Added Web Lookup.
- Made contest .ini file selection a menu in inied.tcl.

2_4_1 - 

- Added new Pass Band checkboxes so you can tell the seat you're passing to
  (and all other multi-op seats) what bands a guy has.
- Added an option to disable Super Lookup's response to RoverLog prompting
  to use a found callsign/grid.
- Added a confirm dialog when deleting a record in Super Lookup.
- Super lookup now ignores "/R" etc.
- Super lookup now displays out grid first, then Lat/Lon.
- Added an option to allow Super Lookup to search as you're typing.
- Made it so the log now scrolls to the bottom after logging a local QSO.
- Rotor Module now supports DDE interface with user-specified service/topic.
- Added a concept of a sked that has been made. It's not deleted, just marked
  as complete. "Made" skeds are displayed in grey.

2_4_2 - 

- To speed up log loading, fill up the call stack only after the whole log has
  been loaded.
- Made annunciator and pass indication more pronounced.
- For sked window, added earlier/later buttons where scrollbar would be.
- Remove automatic azimuth in notes when making a pass or sked, it causes
  confusion if the operator changes the grid square without adjusting the Az.
- Moved send log and send skeds buttons away from net message on net window.
- Prompt to confirm sending whole log/skeds from Net window.
- Fixed: enter N2LB, space, EN99, space, T (to finish call), space.  Grid
  lookup happens, but I typed EN99.
- Super lookup, convert city, st to st-city for lookup
- Added an "Info" window to review old annunciator messages. Click on Info...
  to reveal.
- Made it so Super lookup does not cause Roverlog to lock up when RoverLog is
  set up to use Super lookup responses.

2_4_3 - 

- Made map size configurable.
- Fixed error receiving passes.

2_4_4 -

- Fixed error calculating reverse bearing when a non-zero antenna offset
  has been entered.
- Added Cabrillo 3.0 Log Header Editor. The ARRL robot now accepts this
  version.
- Changed 1.2 to 1.2G, 2.3 to 2.3G, etc. up to 300 to 300G. Logs are corrected
  as they are loaded.
- Added bump functionality for rotors not intrinsically supporting it. This
  is done within the Rotor Module by a query, an increment or decrement of
  one degree, then a position command. THIS IS NOT TESTED, COMMENTS WELCOME.
- When saving log, truncate all grids to 4-digits. COMMENTS WELCOME. Note:
  the contest robot will reject QSOs with 6-digit "Sent" grids.
- Fixed error when cancelling "Save As" and then performing "Save".

To fix your log so it will be accepted by the ARRL robot, do the following:

1. BACKUP YOUR LOG!
2. Start RoverLog with your log.
3. File->Save

When your log is loaded, RoverLog translates 1.2 to 1.2G, etc. 
When your log is saved, RoverLog truncates 6-digit grids to 4-digits.

2_4_5 -

- Fixed bug that would cause the rotor module to fail to start.
- Auto-reap (mark made) WIP and Skeds as they are worked, even if we don't
  explicitly accept WIP.
- Sort skeds by time when saving.
- Make Page Up and Page Down increase and decrease the keyer speed
  from the Keyer mini-window within the main RoverLog program.
- Return to saving 6-digit grids in the log.

2_4_6 - 

- Fixed bug that would raise a "sked isn't an array" error when logging a QSO.
- Fixed bug that would raise a "::setting(lookupgrid)" error when starting
  up without a roverlog.ini file.

2_4_7 - 

- Fixed bug that would corrupt saved skeds file thereby losing all skeds.
- Fixed deleting skeds.
- Popup dialog box to confirm adding skeds in the past.
- Return to sked window when invalid entry is detected when making a sked.
- Add normal windows-type menu to Ini File Editor so you can save from there.
  Because it has always asked you if you want to save when you exit, it will
  continue to do that too.
- Added a status field on the station information window that tells you who
  the other multi-op stations are working or what window the operator has open.
  This could be expanded in the future to indicate what the operator is doing
  as far as RoverLog can tell.

2_5_0 -

- Some stuff.
- Clock did not restore its location.  Fixed.
- Mark peers red if they are out of touch on the network.  This does not affect
  normal operation, and it is cleared automatically when the peer comes back.
  This will indicate if there are network issues.
- Reduce number of messages logged to Net Log to make verbose logging more
  useful.
- When sending a sked, popup a message if the peer is incommunicado.
- Fixed 'can't read "stuff(blacklist,lookup)": no such element in array' error.
- Made Update rate 1 second instead of 10 seconds.
- Colorized Pass button on Station Info window to indicate the seat is ready
  to receive a pass (green) or should be consulted or skedded (yellow).
- If Log Sorting is disabled, put busy controls on the main window to 
  allow the operator to set/clear his busy status for passing from there.
- Improved rig control and QSYing to retain the last operating frequency
  by band and send it to the rig (if any) when QSYing to the band.
- Speed up Super lookup with large databases by using indexing vs. the default
  linear search.
- Fixed: Can't change a working frequency for some reason.  It refreshes to the
  default value.
- Fixed: Passing to 10368.1, Band shows up as 300G instead of 10G.
- When you change bands on pass window, if RL doesn't know the op freq for that
  band, use the best we know.
- Made the act of passing recommend the next available time for a sked if the
  target operator is busy.
- Pass window correctly picks the next free time for the target seat.
- If a sked is marked made, hide it in the display so it is not distracting.
- If a sked is marked made, overwrite with a new sked without confirmation
  dialog.
- Revised the "make pass" function to handle either passes or skeds.
- Upon completing a QSO, clear busy timer.
- Fixed issue with Super lookup Zip/FCC database where the program seemed to
  go into a tight loop on some machines.
- When I bring up the pass window, then change peers, RoverLog now updates
  the first available time.

2_5_1 -

- Restored lookup of lofreq within Set_Freq to prevent an error calculating
  the current operating frequency.
- RoverLog no longer silently skips logging some dupes.
- Made Super Lookup send all results back to RoverLog upon lookup instead
  of just the first result.
- Fixed the PIJ database to remove the extra space in the notes field.
- Fixed issue that would prevent deleting records from Super Lookup databases.

2_5_2 -

- Fixed "skedrecd" bug when a sked with a 4-digit grid and no notes comes due.
- Skeds that are moved to the WIP list now stay in the sked list with a
  different custom color (default green).
- Skeds that have been made can now be manually deleted from the sked list.
- Made super lookup convert calls to upper case before doing the lookup.
- Fixed "windows(net)" bug when sending log.
- Fixed feature that gave preference to the default Lat/Lon in Super Lookup,
  thereby forcing your grid to FN13MM.
- Fixed serial port naming for ports over COM9: in GPS Module, Keyer Module,
  and Rig Module.  The Rotor Module was already done.
- Added buttons for selecting among all available serial ports in the Modules
  using serial ports.
- RoverLog now allows CALL/R and CALL (w/o /R) in the same grid to count as
  separate QSOs for scoring purposes.
- Fixed: Deleting a dupe lowered the indicated score until the log is reloaded.
- Double clicking on a log entry now edits it.
- Changed the prompt for logging a Rover to make it more clear, specifically,
  it no longer says the call is in the log in a different grid because it may
  no longer be in the log.

2_5_3 -

- Slight improvements to Rig Module, mostly invisible to the user.
- Added option to make RoverLog send voice keying commands to Rig Module
  instead of Keyer module. This works with the Elecraft K3 to trigger the
  radio to play a DVR message within the radio vs. using the PC.
- In addition to sending the last frequency used by band to the rig when
  QSYing, RoverLog now sends the mode as well.

2_6_0 -

- Pretty major feature add: 6-digit grid distance-based scoring. This means
  that 10 GHz contests are supported now!
- Added 10g.ini contest file to support 10 GHz contests.

2_6_1 -

- Fixed problem with distance and bearing calculations identified and
  troubleshot by John Isham (N1QLM).  Thanks, John.

2_6_2 -

- Fixed issues with determining what rules we are running (application
  error with unknown $rules variable).  Thanks to Ken VA3KA.
- Added serout.bat utility for use with a serial band switching aid.

2_6_3 - 

- Added a field for current rotor position vs. desired rotor position in
  Rotor Module and main RoverLog.
- Added capability for main RoverLog to query the Rotor Module so it can
  update the current position in the Calc window.

2_6_4 -

- Added checkboxes for looping for each keyer message so some can be on and
  some can be off.
- Fixed an issue with redrawing maps where just your current grid would light
  up and all bands were considered, not just the current one.

2_6_5 -

- Fixed an issue where the mode for several rig types was not properly obtained
  from the radio by the Rig Module.

2_6_6 -

- Added an option to make RoverLog stay on top of other windows.
- Corrected sending microwave frequencies to Elecraft K2 and K3 rigs.
- Corrected distance-based scoring to properly count only unique calls per
  band.
- Renamed the old Log Header Editor and skipped creation of a link to it
  during installation to prevent making old Version 2.0 Cabrillo headers.

2_6_8 -

- Added Yaesu FT-897 Support.
- Added range in kilometers to display.
- Added support for 2 rigs via Winkey.
- Fixed extra key/dekey before every keyer transmission.
- Converted peer communications to UDP to reduce network traffic and
  increase reliability.

2_6_9 - 

- Updated to new FreeWrap shell.
- Added missing udp 1.0.9 library to installer.

2_6_10 -

- Changed Ini defaults to avoid trying to reach other RoverLogs and Modules
  via the network to stop sluggishness when they are not there.
- Rotor Module talks to ProSisTel rotor controllers with integers now instead
  of floats.
  
2_6_11 - 

- More intensive checking of GGA sentences in GPS Module.
- Better handling when GPS isn't there---GPS Module sets date/time to system
  values and main program displays a message in the annunciator and black-
  lists if the GPS isn't there.
- Improved handling when missing or cannot open Icon files.
- Fixed Icom mode set function bug.
- Added keyer option to key voice keyer serial port when sending CW.

2_7_0 -

- Revamped all networking to use "permanent" TCP sockets instead of the much
  older temporary TCP sockets and more recent blocking UDP sockets.  This
  should greatly improve performance.
- Catch errors writing to network sockets.

2_7_1 - 

- Try to get WIP, etc. from a host if unblacklisted.
- Tweaked what to do for passing so that we still try to pass if we don't know
  WIP, BUSY, or WIPLIMIT.

2_7_2 -

- I forgot.

2_7_3 - 

- Added distanced-based log sheet export to a ".1og" file.  See File->Export.

2_7_4 -

- Added August UHF distance scoring.
- Added lookup methods AE7Q Hamdata, removed ARRL

2_7_5 - 

- Fixed bug in calculating distance/multiplier scoring.

TODO -

- Fix this in a better way:
  Enter a partial call, space to grid, put in a couple of chars,
  space back to call, finish it, space back to grid - whole grid is
  highlighted, any typing erases it.  Want a cursor at the end.
- Chase down a reported "datetime" issue.
- Document CW transcription to message 6.
- If possible, allow keying the transmitter for voice keyer messages via WinKey.
- Store/Reload WIP if the user quits/restarts the program.
- Update the manual.
- Make a way to log all network traffic to a flat file.
- Log passes into net window w/ bold.
- When scheduling or passing, allow selection only for bands the peer has.
- For passing, need some indication that the station accepted the pass.
- Super lookup multiple databases in turn in same window with different colors.
- Make a way to allow scrolling commands and arrows to be passed through to
  log, sked list, match list, etc. from any entry/widget on each window.
- Add an option to color the log as loading instead of all entries black.
- Check with the rig server just as logging a QSO to get the current mode.
- Typing in net log and score window modifies those windows.  Make typing
  go into net message field.
- Maybe use F-keys for peer on pass and sked windows.

- Consider adding a tabbed interface instead of multiple floating windows.
- Add a metaconfiguration tool to propagate configurations to all stations
  in a multi-op network.
- Check default WinKey CW mode (vanilla, Farnsworth, etc.).  It seems like
  the characters are sent quick with extra space between them.
- Add a QSO rate meter.
- Add external log utilities (time shifting, extract all for a call, extract
  all for a band, sorting).
- Support Notes for each individual log entry.
- Support a by-band bearing calculator offset. I.e. if I want North, I
  really point to X degrees.
- Support Chat message priorities.
- Add lookup by grid.
